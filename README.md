# stm32f4-audio-signal-processing
Using the STM32F429 microcontroller to process audio amplitude and frequency from a microphone. Voltage peak-to-peak is acquired and FFT is applied to convert time based signals into the frequency domain. Audio amplitude and frequency are displayed using the on-board STM32429 LCD. TM libraries were used.

The hardware schematic is linked.
